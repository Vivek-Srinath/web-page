            The modern manufacture of furniture, as distinct from its design, is a major mass-production industry in
            Europe,
            the U.S., and other advanced regions. It is very largely a 20th-century industry, its development having
            awaited
            the growth of a mass consumer market as well as the development of the mass-production technique. Earlier
            furniture making was a handicraft, going back to the most ancient civilizations.
